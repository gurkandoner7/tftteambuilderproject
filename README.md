I have developed a project that provides the ability to create compositions for a popular strategy game called Teamfight Tactics. 

Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game set in the League of Legends universe. Players build teams of champions and strategically position them on the battlefield to engage in automated battles. The objective of the game is to defeat other players and create the strongest team possible. TFT consists of combat phases and planning phases. 
 
In this project, I worked with nested and interconnected adapters, utilizing my algorithmic and problem-solving skills. It was a project where I prioritized clean architecture and made logical operations as modular as possible. To achieve this, I made use of CustomView and Extension classes.
